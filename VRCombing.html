            <p>VR Combing Cat</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Ghvfulwvskrq">
            <p>I have a 2-year-old Maine Coon cat named Dudu in my apartment, and she is a long-hair cat who needs combing every day. However, sometimes I forget to comb her due to busy work, and her hair is so long that it always tangles. What’s more, she is the kind of cat with her own temper and personality, and she sometimes does not like combing. Therefore, she will always move and meow when I comb her. It is really a hard time for me to comb her, and I sometimes try to escape from that daily routine. What’s more, there are a lot of combs and brushes in the pet stores. And I do not know the difference and when I should use it. It is hard to tell by the instructions video, and there are few instructions on the product box.</p>
            <p>Therefore, I came up with the idea of a VR Combing Cat Simulator where you can learn how to use the different tools correctly and comb with your cat at ease.</p>
